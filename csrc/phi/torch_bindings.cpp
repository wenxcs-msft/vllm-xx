// Note on op signatures:
// The X_meta signatures are for the meta functions corresponding to op X.
// They must be kept in sync with the signature for X. Generally, only
// functions that return Tensors require a meta function.
//
// See the following links for detailed docs on op registration and function
// schemas.
